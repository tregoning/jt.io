![me, playing with an Apple II](/img/me_appleII.jpg =800x548)

Hello, I'm John, by day I can be found at [Flickr][2] where I work among a [talented group][3] of developers as part of
the front-end team. When I am not coding I like to snowboard, photograph things and play with as many Web technologies
as spare time allows me.

I currently live in lovely San Francisco. I went to University in London where I lived for well over a decade. As a kid,
I was brought up in South America, Caracas. As a result my accent is a confusing blend of British and Spanish with a
touch of American.

I am an advocate for [Open Source][4], [ Creative Commons][5] and the [Open Web][6] in general. I am also a geek for
most things Web, here are a few links:
